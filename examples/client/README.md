# Client guide
Read the [Server Guide](..%2Fserver%2FREADME.md) first before running the client

## Database
We've already created our `client` user, so we can go straight to running our client

## Running client
Simply execute 
```commandline
go run client.go
```
from any place and you should be good to go
